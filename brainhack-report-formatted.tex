\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Self-organization is a fundamental property of complex systems,
describing the order spontaneously arising by the local interactions of
the system components not mediated by top-down inputs. Though,
self-organizing systems typically possess a large number of components
and exhibit complex dynamics, their evolution is deterministic and
governed by a small number of order parameters. This property was used
to model the self-organization of the ocular dominance columns of
the striate cortex in patterns of neighboring stripes \cite{Reichl2012}, 
which respond preferentially to inputs from the left or the right eye. 
In this model the self-organization across ocular dominance and 
orientation preference layers was coupled, were both layers were modeled 
with the Swift-Hohenberg equation \cite{Hohenberg1992}. We reduce the model 
complexity by including only the cortical dominance layer and investigate the 
parameter dependency of the self-organization with a Matlab implementation. 

\section{Approach}\label{approach}

The Swift-Hohenberg equation \cite{Hohenberg1992} was used to model the 
self-organization of the ocular dominance columns. There are two order 
parameters in this equation, the first one determines the spatial wavelength 
\(\lambda\) of the stripes and the second one the branchiness \(\epsilon\) 
of the pattern. $\Delta$ is the Laplace operator.
\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}\psi{(x,y,t)}= [\epsilon-(\Delta+\frac{4\pi^2}{\lambda^2})^2]\cdot\psi - \psi^3
\end{equation}
The algorithm used to generate the results has been modified
from an \href{http://nile.physics.ncsu.edu/hon292a-f08/}{open source script}. 
The Swift-Hohenberg equation was solved by 
applying periodic boundary conditions after a Fourier transform to k space, 
which simplifies the computation of the solution.

\section{Results}\label{results}

Figures (a), (b) and (c) show the temporal evolution of the solution to
the Swift-Hohenberg equation for random initial conditions (a), constant
\(\epsilon\) and time increasing from (a) to (c). In (c), (d) and (e)
three solutions with different \(\epsilon\) are shown. The branchiness
increases with \(\epsilon\) from (c) to (e). The wavelength \(\lambda\)
was set to the same value in all figures and the pattern in (d) is
similar to the ocular dominance layers found in the visual cortex.

  \caption{\label{centfig} Examples for the temporal evolution of the 
           solution to the Swift-Hohenberg equation for different 
           branchiness parameter \(\epsilon\).  (a) Random initial 
           conditions for the solution of the equation. (b) Formation of 
           the pattern. (c) Striped pattern for negligible branchiness 
           \(\epsilon\). (d) Complex stripes for medium \(\epsilon\). (e)
           No pattern for large \(\epsilon\).}
\end{figure*}

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

A simple model suffices to study basic properties of ocular dominance
self-organization. Possibly, a combination of models for
self-organization in neighboring cortical layers would allow to
investigate even higher organizational principles of the cortex
\cite{Reichl2012}, e.g.~the coordination between ocular dominance layers,
orientation layers, and cytochrome oxidase.
